This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming: double mutable borrows. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to mutably borrow the same variable twice simultaneously, which is prohibited by Rust's borrow checker. The `bugSolution.rs` file presents a corrected version.  Understanding and avoiding this error is crucial for writing safe and correct Rust code.
